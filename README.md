# Online Pharmacy Website

Welcome to our Online Pharmacy Website project. This platform is designed to revolutionize the way you purchase pharmaceutical products, making it as easy as a few clicks.

## Project Description

Our online pharmacy is akin to an online shop where you can purchase drugs and other health-related products. The convenience of our platform allows you to receive your purchases right at your doorstep, eliminating the need for physical trips to the pharmacy.

This project is developed using the Django framework in Python, a high-level and open-source web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.

## Version

This is the first version of our online pharmacy. We are committed to continuous improvement and updates will be rolled out in the coming month to enhance user experience and introduce new features.

## Team

- **Programmer and Developer**: Alireza Mehraban
- **Designer**: Fatemeh Homayoonfar

The design was completed using the Figma application, a collaborative interface design tool.
